                DISCLAIMER: The sales figures stated anywhere on this funnel are individual sales figures and marketing results. Please understand that sales figures are not typical, and we are not implying that you will duplicate them. The marketing results reported on this funnel are typical results for any clients who meet our criteria and agree to a minimum monthly marketing ad spend. Average marketing results deliver around 30 qualified leads per business every 30 days to customers who subscribe to our services. We back the delivery of our services with a money-back guarantee. We have the benefit of doing marketing for 5+ years, and have an established following as a result. The average person who follows any “how to” information gets little to no results. We are using these references for example purposes only. Sales figures will vary and depend on many factors including but not limited to background, experience, and work ethic. All business entails risk as well as massive and consistent effort and action. If you’re not willing to accept that, this is not for you.
